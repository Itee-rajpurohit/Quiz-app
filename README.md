# Quiz-app
Easy Quiz website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

We can add several questions and four answer options for each question in this quiz app.
If you choose a correct response, the background color of the answer button will change to green; if you choose the wrong answer, the background colour will change to red.
You can only move on to the next question after choosing an answer; you cannot change it further once after selecting it.


When the user submits the answer to the last question and clicks on the next button. Then it will display the score.
